# wine-quality-prediction-using-machine-learning
Wine Quality Prediction project: Using machine learning to predict wine quality based on chemical features like acidity, sugar, and alcohol content. After data preprocessing and analysis, models like Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting were compared. The Random Forest model provided the best accuracy in predicting wine quality.
